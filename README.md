# ck3-hre-de-jure-fix
A mod for Crusader Kings III that adds a decision to incorporate other empire titles into the Holy Roman Empire.

Specifically, kingdom titles of other empires become de jure part of the HRE. This is so that the Princely Elective election law applies to all empire titles of the HRE.
